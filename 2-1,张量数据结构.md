#2-1, tensor data structure

The basic data structure of Pytorch is Tensor. Tensors are multidimensional arrays. Pytorch's tensor is very similar to the array in numpy.

In this section, we mainly introduce basic concepts such as tensor data type, tensor dimension, tensor size, tensor and numpy array.



### One, the data type of the tensor


The data type of tensor is basically one-to-one correspondence with numpy.array, but the str type is not supported.

include:

torch.float64(torch.double),

**torch.float32(torch.float)**,

torch.float16,

torch.int64(torch.long),

torch.int32(torch.int),

torch.int16,

torch.int8,

torch.uint8,

torch.bool

Generally, neural network modeling uses torch.float32 type.

```python
import numpy as np
import torch

# Automatically infer the data type

i = torch.tensor(1);print(i,i.dtype)
x = torch.tensor(2.0);print(x,x.dtype)
b = torch.tensor(True);print(b,b.dtype)
```

```
tensor(1) torch.int64
tensor(2.) torch.float32
tensor(True) torch.bool
```

```python
# Specify data type

i = torch.tensor(1,dtype = torch.int32);print(i,i.dtype)
x = torch.tensor(2.0,dtype = torch.double);print(x,x.dtype)

```

```
tensor(1, dtype=torch.int32) torch.int32
tensor(2., dtype=torch.float64) torch.float64
```

```python
# Use specific type constructor

i = torch.IntTensor(1);print(i,i.dtype)
x = torch.Tensor(np.array(2.0));print(x,x.dtype) #Equivalent to torch.FloatTensor
b = torch.BoolTensor(np.array([1,0,2,0])); print(b,b.dtype)


```

```
tensor([5], dtype=torch.int32) torch.int32
tensor(2.) torch.float32
tensor([ True, False, True, False]) torch.bool
```

```python
# Different types of conversion

i = torch.tensor(1); print(i,i.dtype)
x = i.float(); print(x,x.dtype) #Call float method to convert to floating point type
y = i.type(torch.float); print(y,y.dtype) #Use type function to convert to floating point type
z = i.type_as(x);print(z,z.dtype) #Use the type_as method to convert to the same type of a Tensor

```

```
tensor(1) torch.int64
tensor(1.) torch.float32
tensor(1.) torch.float32
tensor(1.) torch.float32
```


### Second, the dimensions of the tensor


Different types of data can be represented by tensors of different dimensions.

The scalar is a 0-dimensional tensor, the vector is a 1-dimensional tensor, and the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa 2-dimensional tensor.

The color image has three channels of rgb, which can be expressed as a 3-dimensional tensor.

Video also has a time dimension, which can be expressed as a 4-dimensional tensor.

It can be briefly summarized as: there are several levels of brackets, which is the number of dimensions of the tensor.

```python
scalar = torch.tensor(True)
print(scalar)
print(scalar.dim()) # Scalar, 0-dimensional tensor

```

```
tensor(True)
0
```

```python
vector = torch.tensor([1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0]) #vector, 1 dimensional tensor
print(vector)
print(vector.dim())

```

```
tensor([1., 2., 3., 4.])
1
```

```python
matrix = torch.tensor([[1.0,2.0],[3.0,4.0]]) #Matrix, 2D tensor
print(matrix)
print(matrix.dim())
```

```
matrix = torch.tensor([[1.0,2.0],[3.0,4.0]]) #Matrix, 2D tensor
print(matrix)
print(matrix.dim())
```

```python
tensor3 = torch.tensor([[[1.0,2.0],[3.0,4.0]],[[5.0,6.0],[7.0,8.0]]]) # 3-dimensional tensor
print(tensor3)
print(tensor3.dim())
```

```
tensor([[[1., 2.],
         [3., 4.]],

        [[5., 6.],
         [7., 8.]]])
3
```

```python
tensor4 = torch.tensor([[[[1.0,1.0],[2.0,2.0]],[[3.0,3.0],[4.0,4.0]]],
                        [[[5.0,5.0],[6.0,6.0]],[[7.0,7.0],[8.0,8.0]]]]) # 4-dimensional tensor
print(tensor4)
print(tensor4.dim())
```

```
tensor([[[[1., 1.],
          [twenty two.]],

         [[3., 3.],
          [4., 4.]]],


        [[[5., 5.],
          [6., 6.]],

         [[7., 7.],
          [8., 8.]]]])
4
```


### Third, the size of the tensor


You can use the shape attribute or the size() method to view the length of the tensor in each dimension.

You can use the view method to change the size of the tensor.

If the view method fails to change the size, you can use the reshape method.

```python
scalar = torch.tensor(True)
print(scalar.size())
print(scalar.shape)
```

```
torch.Size([])
torch.Size([4])
```

```python
vector = torch.tensor([1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0])
print(vector.size())
print(vector.shape)
```

```
torch.Size([4])
torch.Size([4])
```

```python
matrix = torch.tensor([[1.0,2.0],[3.0,4.0]])
print(matrix.size())
```

```
torch.Size([2, 2])
```

```python
# Use view to change tensor size

vector = torch.arange(0,12)
print(vector)
print(vector.shape)

matrix34 = vector.view(3,4)
print(matrix34)
print(matrix34.shape)

matrix43 = vector.view(4,-1) #-1 means that the length of the position is automatically inferred by the program
print(matrix43)
print(matrix43.shape)

```

```
tensor([ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11])
torch.Size([12])
tensor([[ 0, 1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6, 7],
        [8, 9, 10, 11]])
torch.Size([3, 4])
tensor([[ 0, 1, 2],
        [3, 4, 5],
        [6, 7, 8],
        [9, 10, 11]])
torch.Size([4, 3])
```

```python
# Some operations will distort the tensor storage structure, and it will fail to use the view directly, you can use the reshape method

matrix26 = torch.arange(0,12).view(2,6)
print(matrix26)
print(matrix26.shape)

# Transpose operation twists the tensor storage structure
matrix62 = matrix26.t()
print(matrix62.is_contiguous())


# Use the view method directly will fail, you can use the reshape method
#matrix34 = matrix62.view(3,4) #error!
matrix34 = matrix62.reshape(3,4) #Equivalent to matrix34 = matrix62.contiguous().view(3,4)
print(matrix34)

```

```
tensor([[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]])
torch.Size([2, 6])
False
tensor([[ 0, 6, 1, 7],
        [2, 8, 3, 9],
        [4, 10, 5, 11]])
```

```python

```

### Fourth, tensor and numpy array


You can use the numpy method to get a numpy array from Tensor, or you can use torch.from_numpy to get a Tensor from a numpy array.

The Tensor and numpy arrays associated with these two methods share data memory.

If you change one of them, the value of the other will also change.

If necessary, you can use the clone method of the tensor to copy the tensor to interrupt this association.

In addition, you can also use the item method to get the corresponding Python value from a scalar tensor.

Use the tolist method to get the corresponding Python list of values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the tensor.


```python
import numpy as np
import torch
```

```python
#torch.from_numpy function to get Tensor from numpy array

arr = np.zeros(3)
tensor = torch.from_numpy(arr)
print("before add 1:")
print(arr)
print(tensor)

print("\nafter add 1:")
np.add(arr,1, out = arr) #Add 1 to arr, and tensor will change accordingly
print(arr)
print(tensor)

```

```
before add 1:
[0. 0. 0.]
tensor([0., 0., 0.], dtype=torch.float64)

after add 1:
[1. 1. 1.]
tensor([1., 1., 1.], dtype=torch.float64)
```

```python
# numpy method gets numpy array from Tensor

tensor = torch.zeros(3)
arr = tensor.numpy()
print("before add 1:")
print(tensor)
print(arr)

print("\nafter add 1:")

#Use the underlined method to indicate that the calculation result will be returned to the calling tensor
tensor.add_(1) #Add 1 to tensor, and arr will change accordingly
#Or: torch.add(tensor,1,out = tensor)
print(tensor)
print(arr)

```

```
before add 1:
tensor([0., 0., 0.])
[0. 0. 0.]

after add 1:
tensor([1., 1., 1.])
[1. 1. 1.]
```

```python
# You can use the clone() method to copy the tensor to interrupt this association

tensor = torch.zeros(3)

#Use the clone method to copy the tensor, the copied tensor and the original tensor are independent of memory
arr = tensor.clone().numpy() # tensor.data.numpy() can also be used
print("before add 1:")
print(tensor)
print(arr)

print("\nafter add 1:")

#Use the underlined method to indicate that the calculation result will be returned to the calling tensor
tensor.add_(1) #Add 1 to tensor, arr will not change accordingly
print(tensor)
print(arr)
```

```
before add 1:
tensor([0., 0., 0.])
[0. 0. 0.]

after add 1:
tensor([1., 1., 1.])
[0. 0. 0.]
```

```python
# item method and tolist method can convert tensor into Python value and list of values
scalar = torch.tensor(1.0)
s = scalar.item()
print(s)
print(type(s))

tensor = torch.rand(2,2)
t = tensor.tolist()
print(t)
print(type(t))

```
