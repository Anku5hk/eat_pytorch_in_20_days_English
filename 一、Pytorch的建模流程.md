# One, Pytorch's modeling process

<!-- #region -->
The general process of using Pytorch to implement a neural network model includes:

1. Prepare the data

2. Define the model

3. Training the model

4. Evaluation model

5. Use the model

6. Save the model.


**For novices, the most difficult part is actually the process of preparing the data. **

The types of data we usually encounter in practice include structured data, image data, text data, and time series data.

We will use the titanic survival prediction problem, the cifar2 picture classification problem, the imdb movie review classification problem, and the domestic new crown epidemic end time prediction problem as examples to demonstrate the application of Pytorch's modeling method for these four types of data.
